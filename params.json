It includes conventions for\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nSyntax highlighted code block\r\n\r\n# Header 1\r\n## Header 2\r\n### Header 3\r\n\r\n- Bulleted\r\n- List\r\n\r\n1. Numbered\r\n2.

The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
